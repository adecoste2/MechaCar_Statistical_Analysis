* In the above summary one can see that the variables/coefficients that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are Vehicle weight,      spoiler_angle and AWD 

* The above summary output image shows a p-Value of 3.35e-11 which is smaller than the significance level of 0.05%, which in turn indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis and suggests that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

* This linear model has a Multiple R-squared value of 0.7149. Therefore approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model which demonstrates this multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes as effectively as one would want.
